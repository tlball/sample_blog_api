== README

This is a simple, sample blog API application. It uses a Restful API to access users, posts, and categories.

Documentation on how to access these calls can be found in the doc directory.

It runs on Ruby 2.0 and Rails 4 with the rails-api gem to make it more lightweight for the API. It uses a sqlite backend.

To build the database run

    rake db:setup


Functionality can be seen by running the test suite


    RAILS_ENV=test rake db:setup
    rspec
